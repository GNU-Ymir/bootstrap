\chapter*{Ymir releases}

Language specification of the Ymir language. This documentation is about the
language specification, but it is not a tutorial for the language.

The first stable version of ymir is the bootstraped version 1.0. It is defined to be buildable by the cxx\_version (version 0.1 of the compiler written in c++). Associated tools (e.g. gyc, gyllir) the standard library and documentation are released with the same version number as the language release. GYC has two different versions, the GCC version (such as 11.3.0) being the version of the backend and the version of the ymir language (e.g. 1.0). Backend version should not have an impact on the behavior and only frontend version (ymirc version) has one.

\chapter{Native scalar types}

This chapter presents semantic specification about native types and their
associated behavior. It lists the casting, binary, unary, index\ldots operators
and other allowed operations on the presented types. This chapter covers the
specifications of scalar types. Compound types will be covered in the next
chapter. By its very nature, scalar type contains only one value. This value is
never a borrowing of another value. Thus, a scalar type cannot be mutable per
se, but can be used inside a compound mutable type or a mutable variable.

\chapter{Native compound types}

This chapter presents semantic specification about native compound types and
their associated behavior. It lists the casting, binary, unary, index\ldots
operators and other allowed operations on the presented types. This chapter also
discusses the mutability of the compound types as they often present borrowed
values. Some \texttt{pragma} operations are applicable on compound types, but
they will not be covered in this chapter, a specific chapter on \texttt{pragma}
operators is presented in Chapter~\ref{}.
