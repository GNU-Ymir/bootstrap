** Ymir releases

Language specification of the Ymir language. This documentation is about the
language specification, but it is not a tutorial for the language.

The first stable version of ymir is the bootstraped version 1.0. It is defined to be buildable by the cxx_version (version 0.1 of the compiler written in c++). Associated tools (e.g. gyc, gyllir) the standard library and documentation arue released with the same version as the language release. GYC has two different versions, the GCC version (such as 11.3.0) being the version of the backend and the version of the ymir language. Backend version should not have an impact on the behavior and only frontend version (ymirc version) has one.


** Syntax

This chapter presents the syntax specification of the ymir language. It is a
simplified grammar of the source code syntax. It was not verified whether the
grammar is complete, but it was made to be humanly readable, meaning that there
may be some inconsistencies. Improvements and verification would be evidently
greatly welcomed.

** Native scalar types

This chapter presents semantic specification about native types and their
associated behavior. It lists the casting, binary, unary, index\ldots operators
and other allowed operations on the presented types. This chapter covers the
specifications of scalar types. Compound types will be covered in the next chapter.

By its very nature, scalar type contains only one value. This value is never a
borrowing of another value. Thus a scalar type cannot be mutable per se, but can
be used inside a compound mutable type or a mutable variable.

** Native compound types

This chapter presents semantic specification about native compound types and
their associated behavior. It lists the casting, binary, unary, index\ldots
operators and other allowed operations on the presented types. This chapter also
discuss the mutability of the compound types as they often presents borrowed
values.
