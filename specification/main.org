Language specification of the Ymir language. This documentation is about the
language specification, but it is not a tutorial for the language.

* Ymir releases

The first stable version of ymir is the bootstraped version 1.0. It is defined to be buildable by the cxx_version (version 0.1 of the compiler written in c++). Associated tools (e.g. gyc, gyllir) the standard library and documentation are released with the same version as the language release. GYC has two different versions, the GCC version (such as 11.3.0) being the version of the backend and the version of the ymir language. Backend version should not have an impact on the behavior and only frontend version (ymirc version) has one.
