\chapter{Native compound types}
\label{chap:compound}

This chapter presents the semantic specification of native compound types and
their associated behaviour. It lists the casting, binary, unary, index\ldots
operators and other permitted operations on the types presented. This chapter
also discusses the mutability of compound types, as they often contain borrowed
values. Some \texttt{pragma} operations are applicable to compound types, but
they are not covered in this chapter; a specific chapter on \texttt{pragma}
operators is presented in the Chapter~\ref{chap:conditional_compilation}.
