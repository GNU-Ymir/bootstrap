\label{chap:control_flows}

Control flows are local constructs that use values to define the behavior of the
body of a function. There are several different types of control flows, ranging
from simple condition branching to collection iteration through pattern-matching
deconstruction. This chapter introduces the semantic specification of these
constructs. All constructs presented in this chapter are always placed within a
function body.
