\section{Preamble}

Control flows are generally determined dynamically at runtime, where the machine
code generated contains instructions for the control flow, and the specific
branches to traverse are decided during program execution. However, it is
possible to make these decisions statically at compile time using the keyword
\token{cte} for \textit{Compile Time Execution}, subject to certain
requirements. These requirements vary depending on the type of control flow
construct used, and they entail the compiler needing to possess specific values
at compile time. The utilization of cte control flow aligns with the concept of
conditional compilation introduced in
Chapter~\ref{chap:conditional_compilation}.
