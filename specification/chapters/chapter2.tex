\chapter{Fundamental types, constants and variables}

\label{chap:chap2}

This chapter introduces the fundamental programming concepts needed to work with
an imperative language. In such languages, programs are built around constants
and variables, which store data of specific types. This data is then used to
define the behavior of the program through a sequence of statements.

Basic statements can be divided into two main categories:
declarations and instructions. Instructions either modify the contents of
variables or change the global state of the program, guiding its execution
forward. A program written in an imperative language can be thought of as a
recipe: instructions are executed one at a time, in the order they appear,
producing the desired result step by step.
