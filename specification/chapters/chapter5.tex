\chapter{Global constructions}%
\label{chap:chap5}

This chapter introduces the different global declarations that can be made
within a source file. A source code file is organized as a list of global
declarations that are described directly without enclosing symbols. This chapter
presents the module structures, the import semantics and some other global
symbols that can be found at the first level of a source file's symbol
hierarchy. This chapter does not cover some global elements that have specific
behavior, such as custom types presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:custom_type},
macros presented in Chapter~\ref{chap:macros}, or pragmas and other conditional
compilation constructions presented in
Chapter~\ref{chap:conditional_compilation}.
