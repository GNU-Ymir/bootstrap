\chapter{Variables and memory management}
\pagecolor{gray!10!white}
\label{chap:variables}

A variable in Ymir, like in other programming languages, is a symbolic name that
represents a memory location where a value is stored. When the variable name is
used, the program accesses this memory location to retrieve or modify the value.
Depending on the type of variable that is written out, the memory access can be
made differently (e.g., reference variables) or with varying permissions (e.g.,
writing permissions). This chapter presents the different types of variables
that can be defined in Ymir, their memory representation, and their permissions.
All the concepts presented in this chapter are crucial for understanding how
memory is managed in Ymir.
