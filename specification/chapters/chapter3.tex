\chapter{Native scalar types}
\pagecolor{gray!10!white}
\label{chap:chap3}

This chapter dives into the semantic rules governing native types and their
behaviors. It outlines various operations like casting, binary and unary
operations, indexing, and more that can be performed on these types. The focus
here is on scalar types, while compound types will be discussed in the following
chapter. A scalar type inherently holds just one value and doesn't rely on or
borrow from other values. Consequently, it cannot be mutable on its own.
However, it can be part of a compound mutable type or a mutable variable,
allowing for mutability in broader context.
