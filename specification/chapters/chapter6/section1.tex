\section{Preamble}

Variables can be declared at three different locations: 1) as a global variable,
as presented in Section~\ref{sec:global_variables}, 2) as a function parameter
variable, as presented in Section~\ref{sec:function_parameters} and 3) as a local
variable. In every case, the variable is identified by a symbolic name and has a
type that cannot be changed. This type describes the value associated with the
variable. The value can be located on the stack (for local variables and
function parameters), on the heap if the value is a borrowing value (for all
three kinds of variables), or in the text segment for global variables.
