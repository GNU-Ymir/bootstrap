\section{Void}
\label{sec:org409c2d8}

The \token{void} type is a special type that has no value and occupies
\token{0} byte of memory. Unlike other types, it cannot be used to declare
variables. There is no literal to describe a void type, as it cannot take a
value. There is no way to cast a void type to another type, there is no value to
transform. For the same reason, there are no operators applicable to void types.

\subsection{Properties}
\label{sec:orgffa98ee}

The properties of a void type can be accessed by using the \token{::} operator
on a type expression. The properties are:
