\chapter*{Preamble}
\label{chap:preamble}

This book was written for readers who are interested in acquiring fundamental
knowledge in programming and computer science from the beginning, through the
study of the Ymir programming language. The book is designed to be accessible to
programmers at both the novice and advanced levels, offering a foundation of
introductory concepts and the opportunity to explore more sophisticated
subjects. The book organizes topics into chapters, employing a color coding
system to differentiate between types of information. It also includes a
comprehensive specification of the Ymir programming language. The light gray
pages represent specifications; they are not intended to be read during the
initial reading of the book. Rather, they provide more advanced specification
information about language implementations.

This standard of the Ymir language is the initial stable release of Ymir,
designated version 1.1. The standard library is presented, employing the same
version number as the Ymir language, designated as \textit{libmidgard}.
Additionally, the package manager, designated as \textit{Gyllir}, in version
1.0, is used in this book.
